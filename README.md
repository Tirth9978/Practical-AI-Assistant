# 🧠 Practical AI Voice Assistant

A **Python-based AI Voice Assistant** that can **interact with you naturally** — open websites, tell the time, fetch the weather, and more.  
This project simulates how an intelligent assistant (like Alexa or Jarvis) can be built using simple Python modules.

## ✨ Features

- 🎙️ **Voice Interaction** — Speak commands, and the assistant listens and responds.
- 🌐 **Open Websites** — Say “Open YouTube”, “Open Google”, “Open GitHub”, etc.
- ⏰ **Tells the Time** — Just ask “What’s the time?” and get the current time.
- ☁️ **Weather Updates** — Ask “What’s the weather like?” and it gives live updates.
- 💬 **Conversational Feel** — The assistant tries to talk back naturally to your commands.
